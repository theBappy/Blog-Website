        In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
        to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
        gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
        communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
        medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a
        person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or
        felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
        distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present
        when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted
        spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication
        across space and time.

        <br />The process of encoding converts information from a source into
        symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process,
        converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands,
        such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable
        communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or
        written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the
        configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore
        tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and
        numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the
        flags and reproduce the words sent.
